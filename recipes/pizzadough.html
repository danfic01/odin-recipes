            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Here is the part of the page where I share a long, uninteresting story about my grandmother, neighbor or a celebrity who inspired me to make pizza dough.</p>
            <p>Keep scrolling, the recipe is way down below!</p>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine water, yeast and sugar in mixing bowl. Water should feel warm to the touch, but not too hot to handle.</li>
                <li>Gently stir to mix ingredients. This can be done with a dough hook attachment on a stand mixer just like the later mixing steps.</li>
                <li>Let yeast sit for ten minutes to activate. At the end of this period the yeast should look like a puffy pillow floating on top of the water.</li>
                <li>Add salt and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Add flour. Start by adding one cup of flour and mixing the ingredients slowly. When the flour and liquid have throughouly combined add another cup of flour and repeat until all the flour has been added.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface. Continue until all of the igredients of the dough are evenly combined.</li>
                <li>Let dough rest in a lightly oiled container for at least an hour. Cover the container with plastic wrap or a damp paper towel while the dough rises.</li>
            </ol>
